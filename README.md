# Movie Data Analysis Using Pandas and API

##  Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to this movie data analysis project. Ever wondered what makes a movie successful? Is it the budget, the director, the cast, or maybe if it's part of a big franchise? This project dives into a dataset of top-grossing movies to uncover some insights into these questions.

We started by collecting data, tidied it up, and then performed some analysis to find interesting patterns and answer key questions about movie performance. This README will guide you through the process and highlight the main discoveries.

##  Project Files

This project consists of three main Notebooks:

1.  **`data_collection.ipynb`**: This notebook handles the process of fetching movie data. It likely uses an API (like The Movie Database - TMDB) to gather information about top-grossing movies, including details like budget, revenue, cast, crew, genres, etc.
2.  **`data_cleaning.ipynb`**: Raw data is rarely perfect! This notebook takes the collected data and cleans it up. This involves:
    * Dropping irrelevant columns (like `adult`, `imdb_id`, `homepage`).
    * Extracting useful information from nested JSON-like structures (like genres, production companies, spoken languages, collections, cast, director).
    * Handling missing or unrealistic data (e.g., replacing zero values in budget/revenue/runtime with NaN).
    * Converting data types (like changing `release_date` to a datetime format).
    * Merging the movie details with credits information (cast/crew).
    * Reordering columns for a cleaner final dataset.
3.  **`data_analysis.ipynb`**: This is where the magic happens! We analyze the cleaned data to find insights. Key analyses include:
    * Calculating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like profit and Return on Investment (ROI).
    * Identifying the best and worst performing movies based on various metrics (budget, revenue, profit, ROI, ratings, popularity).
    * Filtering the data based on specific criteria (e.g., genre and actor).
    * Comparing the performance of movie franchises versus standalone movies.
    * Identifying the most successful franchises and directors based on metrics like revenue and ratings.
    * Visualizing trends, like revenue vs. budget over time and ROI by genre.

##  Setup & Usage

To run these notebook, you'll likely need Python and standard data science libraries.

1.  **Dependencies**: Make sure you have libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and potentially `requests` installed.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib requests
    ```
2.  **API Key (for Data Collection)**: If you want to re-run the data collection notebook (`data_collection.ipynb`), you'll need an API key from a source like TMDB and insert it into the notebook where indicated.
3.  **Running the Notebooks**: It's best to run the notebooks in order:
    * `data_collection.ipynb` (if you need to fetch data)
    * `data_cleaning.ipynb` (to prepare the data)
    * `data_analysis.ipynb` (to see the results)

##  Key Findings

Our analysis revealed some interesting points about what contributes to a movie's success:

* **Top Performers**:
    * 'Avatar' stands out with the highest profit and ROI.
    * 'Avengers: Endgame' achieved the highest average rating.
    * However, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' had the highest budget but also the lowest profit and ROI among the movies analyzed.
* **Franchise vs. Standalone**:
    * Standalone movies, on average, showed higher revenue and popularity in this dataset.
    * Franchises tended to have higher average budgets.
* **Successful Franchises & Directors**:
    * The 'Avengers Collection' had the most movies and the highest total budget and revenue within this dataset.
    * The 'Harry Potter Collection' (represented by one movie in this dataset) showed the highest average rating for a franchise.
    * James Cameron emerged as a top director based on total revenue generated by his movies in the dataset.
    * Joe and Anthony Russo directed the highest-rated movies on average within this set.
* **Trends**:
    * Revenue generally trended upwards over the years analyzed, often exceeding the budget.
    * Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi combinations were common among these high-grossing films.

##  Conclusion

This project provides a glimpse into the factors influencing movie success using data analysis techniques. By collecting, cleaning, and analyzing movie data, we could identify top performers, compare franchises, and spot trends.
